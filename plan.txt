How to Compare Speed
* Record start and end time
* end - start = time elapsed
* less time = faster

Array: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
* 5 is the target

Linear Search
1
2
3
4
5
Total Guesses: 5

Binary Search
3
4
5
Total Guesses: 3

Hypothesis
* BinSearch is faster in most cases
* Exception: target is at index 0 or is very low

Test Cases
* Should create arrays that are very large
* {100000, 500000, 5000000} elements

Test
* test with different sizes of arrays
* test target at fixed location at worst possible location (last element)
* calculate start and end times and subtract to find time taken (in milliseconds)
* compare time taken with LinSearch and BinSearch.
