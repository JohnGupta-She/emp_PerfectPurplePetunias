How to Compare Speed
* Record start and end time
* end - start = time elapsed
* less time = faster

Array: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
* 5 is the target

Linear Search
1
2
3
4
5
Total Guesses: 5

Binary Search
3
4
5
Total Guesses: 3

Hypothesis
* BinSearch is faster in most cases
* Exceptioin: target is at index 0 or is very low

Test Cases
* Should create arrays that are very large
* 350 mil / 350 bil elements

Test
* test target at different locations
* use guess
* average time
