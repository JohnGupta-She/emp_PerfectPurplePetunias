# PerfectPurplePetunias

## Roster
* John Gupta-She
* Lauren Lee
* Emily Ortiz

## Tests Performed
* Tested arrays of length {100000, 500000, 5000000} with target at the last element each 100 times.
* Recorded start and end times for each test, finding the difference to find how much time it took to find the target 1000000000 times.

## Results
* LinSearch took a significant amount of time for each test.
* LinSearch took a longer time when the array was bigger
* BinSearch took a short amount of time but time still increased as array size increased

## Conclusions
* The results show that BinSearch will always take longer than LinSearch regardless of the length of the arrays.
