Emily: suggested we use counters as an indicator of speedÂ 
Lauren: suggests text cases that would make sure to take specific cases in which the target was in the far left, right, or middle
John: suggests we used our already coded guess methods to test many different random cases and take the average

John: adds that in previous experience testing complicated methods, it usually took more time when the numbers being tested were in the millions/billions. suggests that we use larger numbers in order to make timing easier.
