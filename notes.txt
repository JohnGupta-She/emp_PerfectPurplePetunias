QCC:
* LinSearch returns -1 with parameters (test, test.length()-1)
* How do the first and second tests which are shorter take longer than the third and fourth tests?
* Why do we have to use Comparable instead of int arrays?

DISCO:
* Terminal Message with compiling BinSearch:
Note: BinSearch.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
* Should not matter since we know elements are comparable (Integers).
* 350,000,000,000 is too large for Java's storage capacity.
* currentTimeMillis counts time in the real world but based on our tests, it skews the results significantly.
