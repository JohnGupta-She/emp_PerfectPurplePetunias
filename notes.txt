L03: Get Empirical

QCC:
* LinSearch returns -1 with parameters (test, test.length()-1)
* How do the first and second tests which are shorter take longer than the third and fourth tests?
* Why do we have to use Comparable instead of int arrays?

DISCO:
* Terminal Message with compiling BinSearch:
Note: BinSearch.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
* Should not matter since we know elements are comparable (Integers).
* 350,000,000,000 is too large for Java's storage capacity.
* currentTimeMillis counts time in the real world but based on our tests, it skews the results significantly.

GALLERY TOUR:
----- 3 Lucky Duckies -----
8 different experiments
* Lin vs Bin Search
* Search for 200 random integers vs search for worst case 500 times
* 20 mil vs 50 mil array length

----- Cute Cyclops Cult -----
* Bin/Lin Search for target (worst case) 100 times
* Test on 750k and 100 mil array
* Ran Search Driver 20x
Results
* 750k array: 66% Lin/Bin same amt of time, 33% Bin faster by 1 sec
* 100 mil array: Bin is faster

----- Frog Hats -----
4 experiments
* Loop Runs 20 times (Bin search and Lin search)

0: 9,999,999 int array, same random targets for Bin and Lin, Bin 0 ms, Lin 0-21 ms
1: 10 int array, random targets, Bin 0ms, Lin 0ms
2: Big array and worst case, Bin 0 ms, Lin 18-19 ms
3: Small array and worst case, Bin 0 ms, Lin 0 ms
